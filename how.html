        <p>Wholesale Game Club is a cooperative shopping project that allows its members to get the most aggressive product pricing on board games, card games, miniatures.</p>
        <p>Making it run requires a few compromises though.  Here's how it works.</p>

        <h1>The Rules of Game Club</h1>
        <p>If you can't accept these rules, you're not going to have a good experience with Game Club.  They are not negotiable.</p>
          <section class="feature">
            <div class="rule">First Rule of Game Club</div>
            <h3>You Must Pick Up At Game Club</h3>
            <p>At our warehouse, via a local friend or even at ScrankyCon, you must pickup your order in person.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="feature">
            <div class="rule">Second Rule of Game Club</div>
            <h3>You Must Pick Up At Game Club</h3>
            <p>Seriously, please don't even ask about shipping.</p>

            <div class="rule">Third Rule of Game Club</div>
            <h3>We Pay Sales Tax at Game Club</h3>
            <p>Although we only pay wholesale prices, we are quite legally a retail business.  State of Florida sales tax will be collected on every order.</p>

          <section class="feature">
            <div class="rule">Fourth Rule of Game Club</div>
            <h3>Your Money is No Good at Game Club</h3>
            <p>We only accept Venmo transfers for purchase payments.  We may add more if the Club is popular enough to cover the costs of supporting other forms of payment.</p>

            <div class="rule">Fifth Rule of Game Club</div>
            <h3>We Use Free Shipping At Game Club</h3>
            <p>Our distributors require minimum orders in order to qualify for free shipping.  We won't process a standard order until we meet those thresholds.  Send us a note if you're willing to pay shipping to get something sooner, though.</p>

            <h3>Ordering</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Orders are placed exclusively via email to <a>orders@wholesalegame.club</a>.</li>
            <li>Orders should include product SKU if known, to avoid edition and other confusions.</li>
            <li>Orders are collected until we reach the minimum order size for our distributor.  At that point, everyone with an order in the shipment is billed and we process the batch order.</li>
            <li>You'll be notified by email of your batch number and again when it's ready for pickup!</li>
